<p align="center"> whisper to interact! i'm usually offtab </p>
<p align="center"> I idle often and rarely speak unless spoken to. I promise I'm nice, though I am quite awkward, and can be blunt sometimes.</p>
<p align="center"> Don't be afraid to interact with me, I enjoy talking to new people <i>(I'm just very shy + anxious)</i>. </p>

<p p align="center">This happened months ago now; but I'm gonna keep it visible just so no misunderstandings happen. My <a href="https://github.com/scourgesisters">girlfriend</a> and I were put in a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OeYdNVrhPUUuWY5ePx63WMTl1CMvlFAUmNR-lpOvrgI/edit?tab=t.0">'callout' doc</a> made by thunderbringer/rafa and his friends, <a href="https://spamaltpage.straw.page/">here's my response to that</a> if you're curious. If you have any questions please ask me, I'll be happy to answer.

<p p align="center">If you do have a problem with me, please tell me! I won't know what I did wrong if you don't tell me. We're all grown adults here, let's act like it. </p>

<p align="center">If I'm talking to someone, please don't immediately assume we're friends, we might just be chatting! If they are a bad person, just shoot me a whisper, thank you.</p>

<p align="center">I do not harass people. If you bother me I'll likely just mute you, or hide if its severe.</p>
